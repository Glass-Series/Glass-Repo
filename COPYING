# Copying Guidelines

## Branding

If you do copy this website, I (calmilamsy) ask that you change all branding of glass repo, glass site, glass series, and any other glass projects/entities contained in here to instead be a different name that you control.

The glass icon is not owned by myself, and the glass png file used is licensed according to https://minecraft.wiki/w/File:Glass_JE4_BE2.png#Licensing (CC-BY-NC 3.0)

(In short: Change the names of the projects contained, and you're good to run your own instance/fork of glass repo.)
